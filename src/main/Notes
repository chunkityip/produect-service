Q: Why I am creating another class call ProductResponse instead just using Product class in model? They are the same class
A:  It's a good practice to separate your model entities and the details .I really should not expose your model entities to the outside world.
Because if in the future and in this product class you have added some other two fees which are necessary for about the business model
but should not expose these two fields which are not necessary outside to the outside world.
This is the idea of Abstraction. In this case, DTOs provide a simplified view of data for API interactions , and we as developer adding things at product.
It promotes modularization, separation of concerns, and better code organization.

Q: Why using List to return all getAllProducts
A: Because the list is a duplicate collection of elements which each product is unique and list has the index for Product id which easy to search
Also , list is in order which will sort in ascending order
